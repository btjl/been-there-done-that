## 📝 **Summary**

Singapore is about to celebrate her 60th birthday this year, and the build-up is already buzzing with excitement! On a recent Saturday, I headed down to Marina Bay to catch the **National Day Parade 2025 Rehearsal**, and what started as a casual visit turned into an unexpected discovery — **a perfect sheltered spot** to enjoy the show, **without the crowds**.

I packed some snacks, found a comfy viewing area by the bay, and soaked in the vibrant atmosphere with fireworks, music, and flyovers lighting up the evening.

To make your bayfront picnic enjoyable and stress-free:

- **Food, Drinks & Snacks** – grab them from **Jasons Deli at Marina Bay Sands** for affordable and convenient options.
- **Tissues or Wet Wipes** – toilets are a bit far away, so keep things clean and easy.

## ⚠️ Caution

:::warning
Go easy on the drinks! 🧃 While it’s tempting to hydrate during your picnic, keep in mind that toilets are not conveniently located nearby. Plan ahead so you don’t find yourself doing the “toilet walk” halfway through the fireworks.
:::

:::danger
As the National Day Parade rehearsals draw large crowds, be mindful of crowd density and movement, especially near the waterfront.
Please avoid pushing, stay calm, and always look out for those around you.
Crowd crushes are dangerous — your patience and awareness can keep everyone safe. 🇸🇬
