## ‚òï Nanyang Coffee Breakfast at Wisma Atria

Our walk down memory lane begins with the quintessential Singaporean breakfast. Inside Wisma Atria, I stumbled upon a pop-up stall dedicated to the **Nanyang coffee breakfast**. I explored the different components that make this meal so beloved: the strong, aromatic coffee brewed with traditional methods, the kaya toast with its unique charcoal-grilled flavor, and the soft-boiled eggs. We'll also take a look at some childhood favorites like **gem biscuits** and **five stones**, which bring back a wave of nostalgia.

## üé∂ A Busker's Light Show and a Special Souvenir

As the day winds down, I exit the mall to a delightful surprise: a talented busker with an incredible light display. Their performance was a fantastic and vibrant end to the walk. To cap off the day, I show off the souvenir I purchased from the Takashimaya showcase - a little traffic light button! As a final fun moment, I compare my new souvenir to a real traffic light button on the street, a perfect representation of how this walk connected the past with the present.
