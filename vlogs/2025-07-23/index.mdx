## 📝 **Summary**

I visited **Sembawang Hot Spring Park**, home to Singapore’s only publicly accessible natural hot spring - and it was such a fun and relaxing experience!

Highlights of my visit included cooking eggs at the **Egg Cooking Station**, and soaking my feet in the **Cascading Foot Bath Pool** to relieve some muscle aches.

All for FREE! 😍

## 🧳 What to Bring

:::tip

- A small pail and some eggs - perfect for trying out the Egg Cooking Station
- An umbrella for shade while you enjoy the Foot Bath Pool

:::

:::note
Forgot something? No worries! The **Sembawang Eating House Seafood Restaurant**, located near the park entrance, has you covered. They rent out pails, sell eggs and other ingredients, and even offer a comfy air-conditioned break from the heat. You can also grab a cold drink or snack while you’re there.

## 🔥 Temperature Warnings

:::warning

- The Cascading Foot Bath has several pools with different temperatures: 70°C, 60°C, 50°C, 45°C, and 40°C.
- I **highly recommend** using only the 40°C pool for your feet - the hotter ones can cause burns!
