## üçΩÔ∏è The Dishes

My visit to Kapitan was a fascinating dive into Slavic cuisine. The cozy, decorated interior of the restaurant provided a perfect setting for the unique dishes I was about to try.

### The Holodets Experience: Slavic Meat Jelly

First up was the dish I was most curious about: **Holodets**. This savory jelly, with pieces of meat inside, was a true first-time experience. I learned that its distinctive gelatinous texture comes naturally from the collagen extracted from meat and bones during a long cooking process.

The cold temperature and unique, wobbly consistency were a challenge for my palate. While the flavor was savory and rich, the texture was something I had to get used to. My honest reaction is all captured in the video!

### Borscht: A Classic Red Soup

For the **Eat The World Series**, our letter of the day is **'B'**, and what better dish to feature than **Borscht**! This iconic soup is famous for its vibrant red color, which comes from its main ingredient: **beets**. The soup was warm, hearty, and full of flavor from the beets, other vegetables, and tender pieces of beef. It was a comforting and delicious contrast to the Holodets.

### ü•õ A Fizzy Ending with Kefir

To wrap up the meal, I tried **Kefir**, a traditional fermented milk drink. Its most notable characteristics are its fizziness and distinct sourness. While I appreciated its unique profile, I couldn't help but think how a drizzle of honey would have made it a delightful, dessert-like beverage.
