## ✨ SPARK: A Symphony of "Fireflies"

The **SPARK** installation at the Supertree Grove is a breathtaking sight. Created by renowned Dutch artist Daan Roosegaarde, this eco-friendly display reimagines fireworks in a silent and gentle way. Thousands of tiny, illuminated bubbles-or "fireflies"-are released into the air, gracefully floating and sparkling against the towering Supertrees. It’s a peaceful, artistic experience that contrasts beautifully with the bustling city just beyond. The free-to-enter event adds a special touch to any evening at Gardens by the Bay.

## 🚶‍♀️ The Night Walk to Marina Bay Sands

Following the light show, I took a delightful stroll on the bridge leading toward Marina Bay Sands. This walk is an experience in itself, offering a fantastic vantage point to admire the cityscape at night. From the bridge, you get a clear view of the surrounding skyscrapers, all lit up and shimmering on the water's surface. The walk culminates with an up-close look at the stunning architecture of Marina Bay Sands, where I took the escalator up for a different perspective of this magnificent building.
